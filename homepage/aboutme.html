            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello there, my name is Luis Ortega. For these past few weeks I have been having fun solving all kinds of problems in CS50. It has really given me a lot of confidence that I can do something that I am passion about and learn a lot from just this class alone.</p>
            <p>I am really glad I took this class and will continue to look forward to all lessons. For now, a little about me would be that I am currently 21 years old living in California. I have 2 dogs, a husky and a german shepard that I love so much. My hobbies are playing paintball, games, and love to work with computers at all times.</p>
            <P>I am also learning a little bit of Japanese as I would love to visit Japan one day and explore its beautiful culture in the future. That is all for me, feel free to contact me at any time and maybe we can chat a bit about CS50 or anything else.</p>
